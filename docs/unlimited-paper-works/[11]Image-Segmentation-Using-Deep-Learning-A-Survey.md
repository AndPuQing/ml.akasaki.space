之前读过一篇[图像语义分割综述](./[10]overview-of-semantic-segmentation)，不过那一篇比较老了（是2017年的），这次来读一篇2020年的。

## Abstract（摘要）

> Image segmentation is a key topic in image processing and computer vision with applications such as scene understanding, medical image analysis, robotic perception, video surveillance, augmented reality, and image compression, among many others. Various algorithms for image segmentation have been developed in the literature. Recently, due to the success of deep learning models in a wide range of vision applications, there has been a substantial amount of works aimed at developing image segmentation approaches using deep learning models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing, covering a broad spectrum of pioneering works for semantic and instance-level segmentation, including fully convolutional pixel-labeling networks, encoder-decoder architectures, multi-scale and pyramid based approaches, recurrent networks, visual attention models, and generative models in adversarial settings. We investigate the similarity, strengths and challenges of these deep learning models, examine the most widely used datasets, report performances, and discuss promising future research directions in this area.

这篇论文对深度学习技术在图像分割领域的介绍是非常详尽的，推荐你阅读[原文](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05566)。这里只是对这篇论文的粗浅笔记。
